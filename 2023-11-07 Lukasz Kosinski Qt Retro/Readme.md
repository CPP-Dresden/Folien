# A Qt Framework Retrospective
## 128 Qt and C++ Projects Later: A Sober Look at the Qt Framework
Łukasz Kosiński


## Abstract

After being involved in over 128 Qt and C++ projects, I will summarize the journey through the landscape of the Qt framework.

We'll discuss what the Qt framework is and diving a bit into its history. For the C++ enthusiasts, we’ll delve into the core characteristics and mechanisms that make Qt a choice for many. Real-life examples? Absolutely. I'll share some fascinating case studies from my journey that highlight both the might and the missteps of Qt. And, of course, no journey is complete without some reflection: we'll celebrate the strengths of Qt but also take an honest, no-holds-barred look at the concerns and issues faced by its users.
