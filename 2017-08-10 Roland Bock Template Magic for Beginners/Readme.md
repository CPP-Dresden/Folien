# Template Magic for Beginners

by Dr. Roland Bock

## Abstract

Many expert talks on C++ simply assume that you know your way around Template Meta Programming (TMP) and jump right into it. Sometimes the presented code and functionality will almost seem like arcane magic to the untrained eye.
In this talk I will give you an introduction to commonly employed TMP techniques like partial specializations, SFINAE, type traits, tag dispatch, and CRTP. The talk will include real world examples and hints as to how some of these techniques are influenced by the development of the language.
You won't become a template wizard within this one hour, but you will have a better idea of what is going on the next time you encounter TMP. And maybe you will develop an appetite for exploring the world of TMP yourself?
