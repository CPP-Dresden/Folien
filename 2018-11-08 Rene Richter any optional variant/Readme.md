# any optional variant - C++ 17 vocabulary types

Ren√© Richter

## Abstract 

Every programming languange comes with a system for data and types, static or dynamic, strict or relaxed.
To understand where we did come from might affect our ability to go on in with modern C++.
In 2017 `optional<T>`, `variant<Ts...>` and `any` were introduced.

The (short) presentation is intended to start a discussion around:
* How do these vocabulary types fit into the type system? 
* Is the type system now complete? 
* What about the proposed `Expected<T,E>` and other ways to return function results / exceptions in future versions of C++?
